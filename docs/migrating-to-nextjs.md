# Migrating to Next.js

The app is built around CRA (Create React App), but there are moments when you need a SSR (server
side render) system. In order to ensure that every search engine is able to index the pages
correctly, one of the most popular alternatives is [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).

## Steps to migrate

There are a few steps that you should consider when migrating to Next.js. Here are the
[official docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/migrating/from-create-react-app)

### Dependencies

Install `next` dependency.

Remove `react-router`, `react-router-dom` and `react-scripts` dependencies.

### Scripts

Open `package.json` from project's root folder and replace

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject"
}
```

with

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
}
```

### Convert entry file

Create React App uses the `index.html`
as [entry file](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-the-public-folder), whereas in Next.js uses
a custom `_document.js` file that has to be created in the `pages` folder.

All `<head>` code should be moved in `_document.js`
file [(learn more here)](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-document).

### Shared layout

Next.js uses a custom `_app.js` file that wraps every route and can be used as a shared layout (
container), similar to the `App`
component [(learn more here)](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app).

Note that the app uses an `index.js` file as a wrapper over `App` component to pass required data
from a top level, so you may need to move that logic.

### Routing & Linking

Next.js is able to create the routing system using
a [folder based structure](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction).

To make the migration easy, this project has a similar folder structure, and its current routing
system makes use of components from `src/containers` folder.

1. Since the project uses `PascalCase` for component file names, it is recommended to rename the
   files to `dash-case`
   or `snake_case`.
2. Dynamic paths use the pattern `[slug].js` (`[dynamicParam].js`), so you may need to use the same
   strategy for some file names.
3. Remove `useRoutes` from `App` component.
4. Replace `Link` component from `react-router-dom` with Link component from `next/link`.

### Server Side Rendering

Using Next.js you are able to load your data using SSR before rendering the page on client side. 
This is a really helpful feature that may or may not apply to your particular case. 

To enable SSR you need to adapt the pages to export a function that will execute on the server, 
then the server will pass the props returned from that function down to your page.  

```jsx
// Page component
const Customers = ({ customers }) => {
  // Render data...
};

// This gets called on every request
export const getServerSideProps = async () => {
  // Fetch data from external API
  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)
  const data = await res.json()

  // Pass data to the page via props
  return { 
    props: { 
      customers: data
    } 
  }
}

export default Customers
```

This would be an alternative for the following client side rendering method

```jsx
const Customers = () => {
  const [customers, setCustomers] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const getCustomers = async () => {
      // Fetch data from external API
      const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)
      const data = await res.json();
      
      setCustomers(data);
    };
    
    getCustomers();
  }, []);
  
  // Render data...
};
```
